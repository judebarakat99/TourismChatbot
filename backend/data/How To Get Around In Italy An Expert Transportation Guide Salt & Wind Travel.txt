How To Get Around In Italy: An Expert Transportation Guide — Salt & Wind Travel
Main Train Companies and Services

The national railway network connects nearly every major city and many smaller towns, offering a convenient and scenic way to move across regions. The two main companies are:

Trenitalia this is the national rail service and they operate multiple levels of high-speed trains like Frecciarossa, Frecciargento, and Frecciabianca. If you plan to visit smaller cities or rural areas, Trenitalia’s regionale trains will get you there, albeit at a slower pace with more stops.

Italo Treno is a private competitor offering sleek trains and competitive ticket prices between main cities like Rome, Milan, Naples, and Bologna.

Pros of Train Travel
Quick and reliable between urban centers
Scenic routes (especially along the Riviera, the Alps, and the lakes)
Eco-friendly and less stressful than driving
Ideal for short trips between popular destinations

Cons of Train Travel
Higher fares if you book at the last minute
Some smaller towns require bus connections
Regional train delays aren’t uncommon in rural zones
The trains often strike during high season

Traveling by Bus
When researching how to get around in Italy, you’ll hear less about buses, but don’t pass them up. Buses fill the gap for places trains don’t reach, like San Gimignano, Chianti, or smaller cities in Sicily. They operate on two levels: 

Regional buses run by local governments
Private long-distance buses (like FlixBus, MarinoBus, and Itabus) connect bigger cities and tourist hubs
In Tuscany, Autolinee Toscane connects Florence, Siena, and Pisa, while in Lazio, Cotral links Rome with towns like Tivoli and Viterbo. Tickets can usually be purchased at tabacchi (newsstands), bus terminals, or online. Some drivers sell tickets onboard, but you must have exact change.

Know Before You Go
Bus timetables vary by region and season. During summer, routes to coastal destinations (like the Amalfi Coast) often increase frequency, while rural services can reduce on weekends.

Pros of Bus Travel
Budget-friendly option for longer journeys
Reaches smaller cities and local attractions off the rail network
Often scenic through the countryside and hill towns
Cons of Bus Travel
It can be slower due to traffic congestion
Limited schedules in rural regions
Less luggage space and occasional confusion over validation rules

Traveling by Airplane
Most international travelers arrive in Italy by airplane, but you can also fly within the country for long distances. Domestic flights within Italy are operated primarily by ITA Airways (Italy’s national carrier) and budget airlines such as Ryanair, EasyJet, Volotea, and Veuling. Flying is generally fast and inexpensive if booked early, so it’s a solid option.

Main Airports & Carriers
Italy’s main international gateway airports are:
Rome Fiumicino (FCO)
Milan Malpensa (MXP)
Venice Marco Polo (VCE)

When flying to Florence, consider landing in Pisa or Bologna for better direct flight options and lower fares. Both are connected to Florence by quick train services. To avoid the craziness of Fiumicino in Rome, consider Ciampino and, instead of Malpensa, look for options at Linate or Bergamo.

Pros of Air Travel
Fastest for north–south routes or island trips
Frequent flights to Sicily and Sardinia
It can be cheaper than high-speed trains if booked early
Cons of Air Travel
Airport transfers and security lines can offset time saved
Strict baggage policies on budget airlines
Customer service is often seriously lacking and not helpful if you hit a SNAFU
Some smaller airports lack late-night public transport


Traveling by Rental Car
Yes, the train or bus is more eco-friendly when considering how to get around in Italy. But driving in Italy offers unparalleled freedom and flexibility, especially for exploring off the beaten track, small villages, or coastal areas not served by trains. However, there is more to consider.

The Reality of Driving in Italy
In theory, getting around by car is pretty straightforward. The country’s major highways, or autostrade, are marked with green signs and well-maintained.
But in practice, driving in Italy can be complicated. The lack of clear signage, the language barrier, the toll roads, the road rules, and general driving differences (Italians drive aggressively) can make it stressful. I often recommend our clients skip driving in favor of private drivers and public transportation.

Pros of Driving
Unmatched flexibility and independence
Ideal for countryside stays, wine regions, and coastal drives
Great for small group trips or families
Cons of Driving
Expensive tolls, parking challenges, and ZTL zones
Stressful in urban areas
Traffic can be really heavy during holidays or the summer
Fuel prices are higher than in the U.S.

Traveling by Car Service
If you want to travel comfortably, with flexibility, and with a local expert at the wheel, private drivers in Italy (known locally as NCC (noleggio con conducente)) are a great option. Most of our luxury travelers to the country opt for car service when deciding how to get around in Italy.

They’re ideal for airport transfers, day trips, larger groups, or longer transfers where you want to sightsee. For example, our clients hire a private driver to:

Stop in Bergamo or Verona while transferring from Milan to Venice
Visit the Mount Etna wine country between Taormina and Siracusa
Explore Chianti wineries en route from Florence to Siena
Combine a Naples–Amalfi Coast transfer with a visit to Pompeii

How It Works
Private drivers are professionally licensed and regulated under the same NCC system as high-end rideshare services like Uber Black. They typically use luxury sedans, SUVs, or vans (Mercedes V-Class being the most common for small groups). You can book through travel planners (like us!), concierges, or reputable online companies.

Unlike taxis, NCC drivers can pick you up anywhere, wait for you during stops, and provide door-to-door service. Most speak some English and are familiar with local culture, hidden restaurants, and less-touristed attractions, which turns even a transfer into a mini guided experience.

When to Use a Private Driver
Airport Transfers: Seamless and stress-free, especially after long flights
Longer Transfers: Turn travel days into sightseeing adventures
Day Trips: Visit multiple smaller cities or vineyard regions without worrying about driving or parking
Groups: Cost-effective when splitting the fare among several travelers
Pros of Hiring a Private Driver
Door-to-door convenience and no parking hassles
Local insights from experienced, licensed drivers
Ideal for families, small groups, or travelers who prefer comfort and control
Can easily combine multiple stops into one Italian itinerary

Cons of Hiring a Private Driver
More expensive than trains or buses
Requires advance booking, especially in the summer months
Limited availability in remote areas unless prearranged


Things To Consider Before You Travel
When choosing how to travel around Italy, travelers should keep the following points in mind:

Check for strikes (scioperi) affecting train services, bus routes, or flights.
Combine modes of travel (e.g., train and car rental) for flexibility.
Illegal cabbies may run scams in some ports or taxi stands, so only use accredited services.
During the summer months, reserve transport well in advance.
Limited mobility travelers are being better accommodated than in the past. However, it is still tricky to navigate Italy.
