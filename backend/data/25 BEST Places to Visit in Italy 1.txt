Italy holds a special place in our hearts. We have visited Italy six times over the past ten years, exploring Italy from top to bottom. With each trip, our love for this incredible country grows even deeper. This list highlights our favorite places to visit in Italy. It might seem extensive, but believe it or not, this is the narrowed-down version!

Best Places to Visit in Italy
1. Rome
🗓️ Best Time: April, May, September, October
⏱️ How Long: 2 to 3 days
🛏️ Where to Stay: City center

Rome. Just hearing the name conjures up some of the most famous landmarks in the world…the Colosseum, the Sistine Chapel, and the Vatican. The history here spans 28 centuries, making Rome one of the oldest inhabited cites in Europe (and one of the best places to visit in Italy).

This city is a wonderful blend of historical sites, charming piazzas and neighborhoods, world-class museums, and iconic sites. For the first-time visitor, Rome belongs at or near the top of your list. It’s a big, bustling city but the main sites are clustered around the historic city center.
Top Experiences in Rome: The Colosseum, the Pantheon, Trevi Fountain, the Vatican Museums and Sistine Chapel, and the Borghese Museum. Walk through the historic heart of Rome, explore Piazza Navona and Campo de’Fiori, and have dinner in Trastevere.

Ideas for Traveling with Kids: Rent bikes and bike the Appian Way. It’s a fun way to spend a morning or afternoon, and it’s the perfect sightseeing break for kids. This was Tyler and Kara’s favorite thing to do in Rome (they were 9 and 11 at the time).

How Much Time Should You Spend in Rome? You can hit the main sites in a rushed one-day tour of the city. With two days in Rome you can see the highlights, what we list above under top experiences. With even more time, you can explore Rome’s nooks and crannies, take a food tour, and venture off-the-beaten path.

2. Florence
🗓️ Best Time: April, May, September, October
⏱️ How Long: 2 days
🛏️ Where to Stay: City center, near the Duomo

Without a doubt, Florence (Firenze) is one of the best places to visit in Italy.
This city was the birthplace of the Renaissance and the art museums here are a testament to that. Michelangelo’s David, the amazing Uffizi Gallery, the frescoes on the dome of the Duomo, and the statues that are on display in the historic city center are spectacular sights to see. But there are enough towers to climb, gelato to eat, and shops to visit that you don’t have to feel like you are on museum overload on a visit to Florence.
Top Experiences: See Michelangelo’s David, climb the Duomo, tour the Uffizi Gallery, stroll across Ponte Vecchio, eat lots of gelato, visit the rooftop bars and restaurants, and watch the sunset over Florence from Piazzale Michelangelo.
Hidden Gems in Florence: The Vasari Corridor, the amazing views from the Bardini Gardens and San Miniato al Monte, and the Brancacci Chapel.
3. Pisa
🗓️ Best Time: April, May, June, September, October
⏱️ How Long: A few hours to 1 day
🛏️ Where to Stay: City center
The Leaning Tower of Pisa is world famous. But is it really worth the visit? We say yes, but only if you already have plans to be in the area. Pisa is worth a quick stop if you are traveling from Florence to the Cinque Terre. Take two hours to pose for photos (along with tons of other travelers) and maybe even climb the tower.
Top Experiences: Climb the tower if heights and vertigo is not an issue for you.
How Long Do You Need in Pisa? You can visit Pisa in two hours if you are traveling between cities such as Florence and the Cinque Terre.

4. Cinque Terre
🗓️ Best Time: April, May, September
⏱️ How Long: 1 to 2 days
🛏️ Where to Stay: Any of the five towns
The Cinque Terre is one of Italy’s most scenic spots. It is here that five colorful, gorgeous towns precariously sit on the hills that tumble into the Mediterranean Sea.
Hike it or hop from town to town by train…this is a gorgeous spot to explore in Italy.

Top Experiences: Exploring the five towns…Riomaggiore, Vernazza, Monterosso al Mare, Manarola, and Corniglia. If you like hiking, you can hike between all five towns in one day. The more you hike the more gelato you get to eat. 😉 End in Monterosso and cool off with a quick swim in the Mediterranean.

5. Milan
🗓️ Best Time: April, May, June, September, October
⏱️ How Long: 1 to 2 days
🛏️ Where to Stay: City center
Milan is home to the Duomo, world-class museums, trendy shopping areas, and Leonardo da Vinci’s “Last Supper.” This city is undergoing an architectural Renaissance, z`and it is worth even a few hours on the fastest itinerary.
6. Lake Como
🗓️ Best Time: May, June, September, October
⏱️ How Long: 1 to 2 days
🛏️ Where to Stay: Como, Bellagio or Varenna
Nestled at the foot of the Alps, Lake Como is one of Italy’s most romantic spots. Leave the hustle and bustle of Italy’s cities behind on a visit here.

7. Venice
🗓️ Best Time: April, May, June, September
⏱️ How Long: 2 days
🛏️ Where to Stay: San Marco, San Polo, Dorsoduro
Venice is one of our favorite spots in Italy. Why? It is small and compact, perfect to be explored with just a few days time. Venice is romantic, historic, and gorgeous. The canals, the gondolas, the architecture, the colorful towns of Murano and Burano…what is not to love?
Venice is one of the best places to visit in Italy and makes it to the top of the list for many first-time visitors.
Top Experiences: Wander along the canals, take a gondola ride through the city, see St. Mark’s Square, walk across the Rialto Bridge, and visit the Doges’ Palace and Saint Mark’s Basilica.
