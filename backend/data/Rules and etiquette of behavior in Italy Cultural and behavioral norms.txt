Local customs and etiquette
1.	Greetings and pleasantries: the magic of "Hello":
In Italy, greetings are not just a way to start a conversation but represent the essence of Italian conviviality and hospitality. When you enter a bar or shop, never forget to say "Hello" or "Good morning". These simple words open the doors to warm, genuine interactions. Body language plays a fundamental role: a sincere smile accompanied by a friendly gesture can make the difference.
When meeting with friends or acquaintances, hugging or kissing on the cheeks are common gestures, depending on familiarity. Remember that the number of kisses can vary depending on the region, as can the way of greeting. For example, in Milan it is common to have two kisses, while in other areas it may be just one.

2.	Lunch and dinner: times to be respected
In Italy, meals are not just moments of nourishment, but real social ceremonies. Lunch and dinner follow very specific times that reflect the local culture and the rhythm of daily life.
Lunch, generally eaten between 1pm and 3pm, is an opportunity to gather with family and friends. It is common for restaurants to offer affordable menus of the day, perfect for a refreshing break. If you find yourself in Italy during these hours, don't be surprised if the restaurants are crowded; Italians love to take their time to savor every bite.
Dinner, however, takes place at a later time, usually between 8.00pm and 10.00pm. This is the time when families come together and conversations become more lively. In some regions, such as the South, dinner can start even later. It is not uncommon to see people strolling the streets after dinner, enjoying the lively atmosphere of the squares.

3.	The art of coffee: how to order it
In Italy, coffee is not just a drink, but a real ritual that encompasses centuries of tradition and culture. When you find yourself in a bar, approach the counter with a smile and prepare to live a unique experience. Don't forget, the average Italian drinks coffee on the fly, often standing, and that's part of the charm.
Order your coffee with precision: a simple "An espresso, please" is not only correct, but also demonstrates respect for local customs. If you want something different, remember that the types of coffee are varied and each has its own specific name. Here are some options:
•	Cappuccino: to be enjoyed only in the morning, it is a mixture of coffee and foamed milk.
•	Macchiato: an espresso "macchiato" with a little milk, perfect for those who love a stronger flavour.
•	Latte: be careful, do not confuse it with cappuccino; here you will only get warm milk with a coffee.

4.	Behavior in restaurants: etiquette to follow
When it comes to eating out in Italy, restaurant etiquette is a fundamental aspect of gastronomic culture. Entering a restaurant is not just an act of consuming a meal, but a social ritual that deserves respect and attention. First of all, it is good practice to greet the staff with a polite "Good evening" or "Good morning" upon entry. This simple gesture creates a friendly and welcoming atmosphere.

During the meal, remember that conversation is an integral part of the experience. Speaking in a moderate voice and maintaining a respectful tone is appreciated. Don't forget to use cutlery correctly: in Italy, you eat with fork and knife in hand, and your hands should remain on the table.

When the time comes to order, avoids rushing the waiter. Italians like to take their time to enjoy their dishes, so be patient and order without rushing. When paying, remember that it is customary to leave a small contribution as a tip, generally between 5% and 10% of the total, if the service is not already included in the bill.

Finally, if you are asked to share a table, accept it with a smile: it is a sign of hospitality and openness typical of Italian culture. By following these simple guidelines, you will be able to enjoy the Italian culinary experience to the fullest, immersing yourself in its richness and tradition.

Italian dress code: dress with style
In Italy, the way we dress is not just a question of fashion, but a true art form. Dressing with style is essential to fully immerse yourself in the local culture and to feel at ease in every situation, whether it is an elegant dinner or a walk in the historic center.
Italians are known for their impeccable aesthetic sense and attention to detail. Well-cut clothes, harmonious colours and refined accessories are key elements of a look that attracts attention in a positive way. It's not uncommon to see men in crisp shirts and dress pants, and women sporting chic outfits, even during the day.
Here are some practical tips to avoid looking disfigured:
•	Choose quality fabrics: Opt for cotton, linen or merino wool, which are not only pleasant to wear, but also suitable for the climate.
•	Avoid excess casualness: Wearing jeans and a t-shirt is acceptable, but try to match everything with elegant shoes or thoughtful accessories.
•	Attention at events: During a visit to churches or sacred places, it is advisable to cover shoulders and knees, respecting the rules of etiquette.
Remember, in Italy the dress code is not just a rule, but a way to express respect towards the culture and people you meet. Wearing your best smile together with nice clothing will help you feel part of this magical atmosphere.
